## Getting Started

Switcheo has an excellent guide on how to get started trading on the Switcheo Exchange and can be found [here](https://support.switcheo.network/en/articles/3169551-a-beginner-s-guide-to-switcheo). Similarly the blog for this content can be found [here](https://blog.switcheo.network/the-ultimate-beginners-guide/).

## Unstoppable and Censorship Resistant

Switcheo offers two ways to access its exchange, the first is through the public address [switcheo.exchange](https://switcheo.exchange). The second method is through [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) backed by [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) to allow the Switcheo Exchange to be access from anywhere when using the address [switcheo.crypto](switcheo.crypto)

**NOTE**: Accessing a `.crypto` address requires the use of the Unstoppable Domains browser extension for Chrome or the compatible browser plugin for your specific browser.

## Liquidity

Switcheo not only offers atomic swaps between Neo and Ethereum but for the Ethereum based pairs, Switcheo has been able to tap into on-chain liquidity pools offered by Uniswap [V1](https://blog.switcheo.network/switcheo-integrates-uniswap-liquidity-reserves/) & [V2](https://blog.switcheo.network/switcheo-integrates-with-uniswap-v2-liquidity-reserves/) and the [Kyber Network](https://blog.switcheo.network/switcheo-integrates-with-kybers-on-chain-liquidity-protocol/). What this means is that a deeper liquidity pool allows each market to experience smaller amounts of slippage and keeps spreads at a minimal level.

## Portfolio

Switcheo allows you to add wallets from multiple blockchains and track your portfolio, again there is an excellent guide located [here](https://support.switcheo.network/en/articles/3429193-create-a-switcheo-portfolio).

## Atomic Swaps

Switcheo has pioneered the ability of executing Atomic Swaps plus AMMs on a DEX, the blog announcement can be found [1](https://blog.switcheo.network/switcheo-launches-cross-chain-atomic-swaps-on-ethereum-and-neo/) & [2](https://blog.switcheo.network/switcheo-discovery-how-atomic-swaps-work/) and the support guide can be found [here](https://support.switcheo.network/en/articles/2928618-what-are-atomic-swaps).
