> DeFi is an abbreviation of the phrase decentralized finance which generally refers to the digital assets, financial smart contracts, protocols, and decentralized applications (DApps) built on the blockchain. In simpler terms, it's financial software built on the blockchain that can be pieced together like Money Legos.

## Money Legos

It can be argued that all cryptocurrencies with sufficient enough decentralization such that large parties cannot decide how a network functions are part of DeFi and in many ways there is merit to this arguement. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum provide a novel way to ensure trust amongst all participants on their respective blockchains, there is little you can do with BTC or ETH outside of HODL.

DeFi changes this by offering various ways to turn your HODLing into interest bearing assets. The basic ways this can occur are:

- Decentralized Exchanges
  - Switcheo has already delivered on this and working on a derivatives platform as well
- Lending to earn an APY
  - Similar to a bank account
- Staking
  - Secure the network and earn rewards
- Borrowing for stablecoins
  - Leverage your crypto position
- Liquidity Providers
  - Pool your cryptocurrencies with others to earn fees on trading volume
  - Earn rewards for providing liquidity in different pools
- Insurance
  - Smart Contract insurance for Liquidity Pools or Catastrophic Events
- Governance
  - Vote on the future of the Switcheo Network
  - Propose new changes to the Switcheo Network

Each of these are being offered as part of the Switcheo Network roadmap. There are more topics that can be included as part of the DeFi definition such as DAOs, flash loans, liquidity mining, and community driven projects that optimize everything listed above.

The Switcheo team have also highlighted key features of DeFi in a blog located [here](https://blog.switcheo.network/switcheo-discovery-defi/). The most important aspects to take away from this are:

1. Does not rely on trust
2. Can be accessed by everyone
3. Can be verified and validated by anyone
4. Cannot be shutdown easily
