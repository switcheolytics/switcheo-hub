# Switcheo Network Community Guide

Welcome to the community guide for the Switcheo Network. Started back in 2018, Switcheo has been on the forefront of the Decntralized Economy. The Switcheo Network is a collection of ambitious projects looking to pioneer the Decentralized Financial (DeFi) space. This vision began with the Switcheo Exchange, which is a cross-chain Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that started on the NEO blockchain and has grown to support trades across the Ethereum and EOS networks.

The next stage of growth for the Switcheo Network is rapidly being created and has been years in the making. This collection of documentation is an attempt to consolidate the knowledge base of the rapidly expanding Switcheo Network to help the community reference helpful pieces of information and gain tips or tricks on how to use the tools Switcheo or community members have provided.

Here is a visual guide created by the Switcheo team to help understand how these new projects fit into the ecosystem.
