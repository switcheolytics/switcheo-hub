## Liquidity Pools

> Release TBD

To ensure DEX trading mechanisms can provide the best experience for traders it requires a significant amount of liquidity to ensure minimal slippage and a better user experience for those looking to trade and not wait for maker or taker orders to be available. Enter the "automated market makers" (AMM) that allow token holders to pool their liquidity together to share in trading fees collected and allows for autobalancing of your portfolio.

Switcheo TradeHub will also allow liquidity providers (LP) to earn a percentage of the block rewards based on the trading volume of the liquidity pool. Additionally, to help drive liquidity to smaller pools, TradeHub will also incentivize rewards based on pool size.

## Collateralized Debt Positions

> Release TBD

A permissionless lending mechanism that requires borrowers to deposit crypto assets in return for borrowing another asset. This is to protect the lender in terms of offering assets to liquidate against in case of a liquidation event.

These CDPs can be used to mint USD at a 500% collateralization ratio.

## Insurance

> Release TBD

Minimal to no information on this topic, included as a place holder.

Stakers accrue fees automatically from insurance fund.
Holders earn higher payout by underwriting insurance fund.

## Governance

> Release TBD

The Switcheo Foundation has planned to transition into a full-fledged Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) powered by the SWTH token.

This includes proposals for new markets, not limited to Crypto only assets.

TradeHub Improvement Proposals (TIP)

## Incentives

There are many incentives to look forward to as you can see with the ambitious roadmap and features that have been highlighted above. When trading is live there will be additional incentives for stakers in terms of network and trading fees as 100% of these fees will go toward stakers.

## External Integration

> Release TBD

The Switcheo TradeHub strives to be the backbone of the decentralized financial (DeFi) future. With the benefits of deep liquidity pools, governance, lending, derivatives trading, and many more benefits, other decentralized exchanges can tap into the TradeHub backbone to utilize for their trading platform.

## Oracles

> Release TBD

Oracles are going to be one of the tasks that Switcheo TradeHub Validators are going to be required to perform. This is not yet live but being worked on and required to be released before derivative trading can occur.
